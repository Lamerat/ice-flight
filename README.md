# ICE FLIGHT
## Description
Game is similar to old ATARI game __"River raid"__\
I didn't create levels, I just created the objects in the game (icebergs, ships and helicopters), mainly in order to recall and practice OOP programming.

### Rules
Destroy everything what you see, with ONE exception - Supplies. To take supplies and reload your ammo, rockets and fuel you must pass through, and be careful, supplies too can be destroyed by you. For that don't shoot randomly.

### Controls
* __LEFT ARROW__ - move left
* __RIGHT ARROW__ - move right
* __UP ARROW__ - speed up
* __DOWN ARROW__ - speed down
* __SPACE__ - cannon shoot
* __SHIFT__ - fire rocket
