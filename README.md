# ICE FLIGHT
## Description
Game is similar to old Atari game __"River raid"__
I didn't create levels, I just created the objects in the game (icebergs, ships and helicopters), mainly in order to recall and practice OOP programming.

### Rules
Destroy everything what you see, with ONE exception - Supplies. To take supplies and reload your ammo, rockets and fuel you must pass through, and be careful, supplies too can be destroyed by you. For that don't shoot randomly.

### Controls
LEFT ARROW - move left
RIGHT ARROW - move right
UP ARROW - speed up
DOWN ARROW - speed down
SPACE - cannon shoot
SHIFT - fire rocket
